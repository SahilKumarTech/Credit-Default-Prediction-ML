# Credit Default Prediction using Machine Learning
Machine learning project predicting credit default risk using classification algorithms. The notebook demonstrates dataset exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


This project predicts **whether a customer will default on credit** using machine learning classification algorithms.  
The notebook covers dataset analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Load Dataset** – Credit Default dataset (`Default.csv`).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Explore relationships between features like income, balance, and student status.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Encode categorical variables, scale features, and split into training/testing sets.
4. **Model Training** – Train classification models (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / SVC, etc.).
5. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluate with:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
6. **Visualization** – Plot data insights and evaluation results.
